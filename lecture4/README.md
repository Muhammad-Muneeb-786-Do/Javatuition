# Literals in java

Any value that we assign to any variable is termed as literal and liternal can be any value.

We can assign binary or hex value to an integer and it will automatically convert that value to integer.

we have to place 0b before a binary number.
we have to place 0x before a hexa number.

Plese check code for implementation.
